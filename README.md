# MXNetOnYARN
MXNet on YARN is a project based on [dmlc-core](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core) and [MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet), aiming at running MXNet on YARN with high efficiency and flexibility. It's an important part of Deep Learning on Hadoop ([HDL](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HDL)).

Both the codebase and documentation are work in progress.
